Hi, I’m Susan Kennedy and a longtime database developer.
I’m interested in SQL Server, databases, ColdFusion, GuildWars2 and other online games. I also have three grandchildren that use up a lot of my time.
I’m currently learning more about the newest version of CF.
I’m looking to collaborate on new ways to use ColdFusion.
You can reach me at susan@accessmentor.com.
